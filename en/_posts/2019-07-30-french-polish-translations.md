Adding to a growing suit of multilingual statements, our statements are now published in [French](https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=fr) and [Polish](https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=pl) and are available for everyone to use.  

We'd like to thank our partners in Poland, and the tri-partite effort to develop the French translations by partners from Luxembourg, France and Canada.  We'd also like to thank everyone else who contributed to these translations, through the development of them or the public consultation.  

If you want to view the statements in any of the seven official languages, you can access them [here](https://rightsstatements.org/en/documentation/translations.html).  If your browser is set to a language that the statement has been translated into, you will automatically see the translation.  If no translation has been published in the language of your browser, or your browser is set to English, you will automatically see the English language statements.
