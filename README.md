## Implementing translations

ToDo

## Editing content

### Access CMS

Open `/admin` and log in with GitHub.

### Creating a new post

[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/graphthinking-gmbh/rightsstatementsorg/) is used to carry out translations of the website. The relevant resources are tagged with the category `website`. Please get in touch with the [maintainers](https://www.transifex.com/graphthinking-gmbh/rightsstatementsorg/settings/maintainers/) to add a new language to the project.

To incorporate updates or new translations:

* Install [`tx`](https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction) and run [`tx pull`](https://docs.transifex.com/client/pull#command-options).
* Edit `_config.yml` and `_config_production.yml` to add keys and associated translations for the language you're editing.
* If provided, add any PDF documentation related to the translation to the `files` directory.

Add a **title**, **date**, **body** and click save.

**By default new post are not published** and have the status *draft*, to publish them is necessary to click the `Publish` button

Is also possible to see a preview of the post by clicking `View Preview`, this link takes a while to load since new previews trigger separate build.

Changing the status will only affect how is shown in the workflow view and not publish it.
